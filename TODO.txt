TO DO List for Seed Factory Project Technical
=============================================

------------------
1.0 - Project Data
------------------

- 1.1 Seed Factory Book

This book is intended to be an engineering introduction to the concept of "seed factories", self-expanding
automated factories, where part of the output is parts to expand the factory.

Tasks:

  -- Continue basic text writeup, especially the design example sections
  -- Upgrade photos and diagrams
  

- 1.2 Technical Library

This is intended to supply source data in science and engineering, so that the seed factory designs are
based on good information.  Current status includes about 235 paper technical books, and 41.2 GB of ebook
content.

Tasks:

  -- Complete PDF optimization and standardize on Acrobat 9.0 - Status is 7.81 GB completed
  -- Upload legally sharable portion of data so other project members can use it
  -- Create document index for non-sharable items so other project members know what is being used.
  -- Backup entire library offsite, and local backups
  -- Solicit suggestions for updates/additions to library
  

- 1.3 Engineering Data

This includes drawings, calculations, notes, software code, and other design information for the project.

Tasks:

  -- Upload existing data to this "/data" repository, and create folders as needed to organize it.
  

- 1.4 Organization Data
