<p>The Seed Factory Project is an open-source hardware and software project to design
and demonstrate the technology for Seed Factories. Although the design is open-
source, physical instances of the hardware will be owned by project members and
they will benefit from the products it outputs.</p>

<a name="what-are-seed-factories" class="anchor" href="#what-are-seed-factories"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are Seed Factories?</h2>

<p>A Seed Factory is a new kind of production system which has two major differences 
from conventional factories: self-expansion and integration.  </p>

<p>It includes a starter set of equipment which can expand in three ways to a larger 
capacity, while also making useful products:</p>

<p><strong>Replication</strong> - making copies of its own parts so as to eventually copy the entire 
set.</p>

<p><strong>Diversification</strong> - making parts for new equipment, thus expanding the range of 
possible outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Scaling</strong> - making parts for larger equipment than what is in the starter set.</p>

<p>The factory is designed as an integrated system. It brings together multiple 
production steps from raw materials and energy to finished items.  Each part of the 
factory produces resources needed by the other parts to function, making it 
self-sustaining.  Since the parts are all in one place, the whole production chain 
can take advantage of automation and robotics.  Integrated processes can also take 
waste outputs from one step, and use them as inputs for another.  The combination 
results in a highly efficient design.  </p>

<p>As the factory expands, it produces a growing variety of products for end users, 
and an increasing percentage of the items for its own growth.  The relatively low 
cost of a starter kit, and the low operating cost from integrated processes and 
automation, make this system very desirable on an economic basis. </p>

<p>As a new way to organize production, Seed Factories build on past experience from
Industrial Technology and Engineering.</p>

<p>This is the "Seed Factories" book, hosted on Wikibooks.  It describes the history
and concepts for self-expanding automated factories, how to design such factories
based on the "Systems Engineering" process for complex systems, and several design 
examples.  As of Sep 2013, the book is about 50% complete towards a first draft.
It is an open-source work, and contributions are welcome from people who understand
what they are talking about.</p>

<p>**<a href="https://github.com/seed-factory-project/data.git">https://github.com/seed-factory-project/data.git</a></p>

<p>This is the GitHub repository for the project.  It is intended to contain software
code, design files, and other file types related to the Seed Factory Project that
cannot be stored in the book, which is limited to text and images.  As of Sep 2013
the repository is brand new.</p>
