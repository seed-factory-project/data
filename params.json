Although the design is open-\r\nsource, physical instances of the hardware will be owned by project members and\r\nthey will benefit from the products it outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nWhat are Seed Factories?\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nA Seed Factory is a new kind of production system which has two major differences \r\nfrom conventional factories: self-expansion and integration.  \r\n\r\nIt includes a starter set of equipment which can expand in three ways to a larger \r\ncapacity, while also making useful products:\r\n\r\n**Replication** - making copies of its own parts so as to eventually copy the entire \r\nset.\r\n\r\n**Diversification** - making parts for new equipment, thus expanding the range of \r\npossible outputs.\r\n\r\n**Scaling** - making parts for larger equipment than what is in the starter set.\r\n\r\nThe factory is designed as an integrated system. It brings together multiple \r\nproduction steps from raw materials and energy to finished items.  Each part of the \r\nfactory produces resources needed by the other parts to function, making it \r\nself-sustaining.  Since the parts are all in one place, the whole production chain \r\ncan take advantage of automation and robotics.  Integrated processes can also take \r\nwaste outputs from one step, and use them as inputs for another.  The combination \r\nresults in a highly efficient design.  \r\n\r\nAs the factory expands, it produces a growing variety of products for end users, \r\nand an increasing percentage of the items for its own growth.  The relatively low \r\ncost of a starter kit, and the low operating cost from integrated processes and \r\nautomation, make this system very desirable on an economic basis. \r\n\r\nAs a new way to organize production, Seed Factories build on past experience from\r\nIndustrial Technology and Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nProject Links\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n**https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Seed_Factories**\r\n\r\nThis is the \"Seed Factories\" book, hosted on Wikibooks.  It describes the history\r\nand concepts for self-expanding automated factories, how to design such factories\r\nbased on the \"Systems Engineering\" process for complex systems, and several design \r\nexamples.  As of Sep 2013, the book is about 50% complete towards a first draft.\r\nIt is an open-source work, and contributions are welcome from people who understand\r\nwhat they are talking about.\r\n\r\n**https://github.com/seed-factory-project/data.git\r\n\r\nThis is the GitHub repository for the project.  It is intended to contain software\r\ncode, design files, and other file types related to the Seed Factory Project that\r\ncannot be stored in the book, which is limited to text and images.  As of Sep 2013\r\nthe repository is brand new.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nProject Contacts\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nDani Eder: danielravennest@gmail.com (Conceptual Design Engineer)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
